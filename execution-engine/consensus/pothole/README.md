# Pothole

Pothole is a consensus algorithm with the purpose of being as simple as possible. One of the nodes participating in consensus is selected as the dictator, and the consensus is reached by having the dictator node unilaterally decide what the order of transaction is, then communicating it to the other nodes.

**WARNING:** this is not intended to be used in production anywhere! The only purpose of Pothole is to serve as a placeholder for Highway while Highway and the consensus API within Node are being developed.
